## Description

WaveSabre is a software synthesizer and toolchain for music for [64K intros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64K_intro).

This is a fork of the [original repository](https://github.com/logicomacorp/WaveSabre) that's being developed by logicoma. This fork is being maintained by [Inque](http://glow.inque.org/). We have added small improvements to the various VST plugins, as well as a completely custom-made synthesizer: Pandora.

See [our docs](https://github.com/logicomacorp/WaveSabre/tree/master/Docs) for more info.

## Getting started

Please see [our docs](https://github.com/logicomacorp/WaveSabre/blob/master/Docs/Home.md#building) for prerequisites, building, etc (and let us know what we're missing!).

## Team

WaveSabre is made by [ferris](https://github.com/yupferris) and [h0ffman](https://github.com/djh0ffman) of [logicoma](https://github.com/logicomacorp), with additional contributions by:

- [revival](https://github.com/revivalizer) (knob graphics, premake integration, helping with open-source prep, ...)
- [kusma](https://www.kusma.xyz/) (sin/cos optimization, cmake integration, appveyor config, ...)
- [cpdt](https://github.com/cpdt) ([FL Studio project parser](https://github.com/monadgroup/FLParser))
